        <h1>FRENCH-STYLE HOT CHOCOLATE</h1>
        <p>
            This is the kind of hot chocolate you sip slowly. Thick, creamy, 
            and made with real chocolate, it feels straight out of a French 
            café. Simple ingredients, really good texture and flavor.

        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <p>MAKE THE HOT CHOCOLATE</P>
        <ol>
            <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, add the milk, heavy cream, and 
                brown sugar. Heat gently, stirring occasionally, until steaming 
                but not boiling.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped chocolate and pinch of salt. Whisk continuously 
                until the chocolate is fully melted and the mixture is smooth 
                and slightly thickened.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Pour into mugs and top with whipped cream before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Whipped Cream</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract to a 
                large bowl or stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.</li>
            <li>Whip on medium speed until the mixture thickens and soft, 
                billowy peaks form.</li>
            <li>Stop mixing as soon as the whipped cream looks smooth and 
                fluffy—overmixing will make it grainy and less smooth.</li>  
        </ol>
